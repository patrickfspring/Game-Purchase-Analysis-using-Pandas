Analysis (& discovery) conclusions from completing this reporting project:
1.) Item Prices vary within some of the (same) items. In one instance, the report title was adjusted to call out Average Item Price.
Average purchase price hovered around $3 and the average total purchase per person being in the $4 range.   
2.) Male players were the primary purchaser gender compared to the other two genders.                                                                                               
3.) Age group 20-24 followed by 15-19 age bin made up close to 60% of the purchases.
