Work done for Pandas-Challenge consisted of completing the problems fo the Heroes of Pymoli fantasy game.

Analysis (& discovery) conclusions from completing this assignment:
1.) Item Prices will vary within the same item. In some cases, report titles were adjusted to call out Average Item Price. Average purchase price hovered around $3.  
2.) Many more male players vs the other two genders. 
3.) 20-24 followed by 15-19 age bins made up close to 60% of the purchases.
